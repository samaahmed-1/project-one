Complete data analysis workflow, transforming raw sales data into an interactive business intelligence dashboard. My goal was to provide clear, actionable insights to help the business improve its performance and revenue.

Problem Statement:
The data was disorganized, making it difficult to gain a real-time, comprehensive view of sales health. This project addresses that by centralizing the data and making it easy to understand.

Methodology & Tools:
I utilized Microsoft Excel for initial data preparation and cleaning, followed by dashboard creation By Pivot charts. The dashboard provides a 360-degree view of sales through key visualizations.

Key Visualizations & Insights:
The dashboard includes;

KPIs: Total Sales and Net Income.

Geographic Analysis: A "Top 10 Countries" chart.

Temporal Trends: A chart showing sales performance over different quarters.

Product Insights: Bar charts identifying "Cash Cow" product categories.

Business Impact:
This dashboard provides a single source of truth for sales data. It enables stakeholders to quickly identify profitable markets, understand sales seasonality, and pinpoint top-performing products, ultimately driving more informed business decisions.
